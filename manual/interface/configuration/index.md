can be opened from the [File](../menus/file.md) menu.

## Categories

The configuration is organized into the following categories:

 * [General](general.md)
 * [Appearance](appearance.md)
 * [Keyboard](keyboard.md)
 * [Sound / Midi](sound.md)

## File location

The configuration is stored in an [INI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file)
file, and its location depends on your operating system.
