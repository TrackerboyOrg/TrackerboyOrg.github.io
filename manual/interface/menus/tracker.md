Begins playing the song from the first pattern in the order.

## Play at cursor

a single row at a time.

## Stop

Stops music playback.

## Pattern repeat

Toggles pattern repeat mode. When pattern repeat mode is active, the tracker
will loop playback of the current pattern. Pattern repeat can be toggled at
any time.

## Record

## Reset volume

Resets the global volume scale to max on both terminals. The
[Jxy](../../tracker/effect-list.md#jxy-set-global-volume) effect is persistent
and is not reset when playing a new song. Use this action to reset it. See
[here](../../hardware/volume-control.md) for more details on the global volume
scale.

## Kill sound

Stops all sound output immediately. Differs from [Stop](#stop) in that sound
stops immediately by not letting the playback buffer drain.
