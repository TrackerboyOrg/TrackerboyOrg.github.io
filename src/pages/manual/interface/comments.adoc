image::interface/comments.png[The comments dialog]

The comments dialog is where you can edit the module's comments, or extra
information about the module. The dialog can be accessed from the
menu:Module[Comments...] action (see xref:menus/module.adoc[Module menu]).

You can put any information you want about your module here. There is no
character limit for this field so write as much as you want! By default
the comments section is empty for new modules.
