The audio diagnostics dialog is a utility for displaying statistics about the
audio from the current render being played out. It can be opened by selecting
the menu:Help[Audio diagnostics...] action in the xref:menus/help.adoc[help menu].

== Statistics

* *Underruns* - This is the total count of underruns{fn-underruns} that have 
occurred. Ideally this statistic should be zero. If you get underruns try
increasing the xref:config/sound.adoc#buffer-size[buffer size] in the
{ln-audio-config} config.

* *Buffer Usage* - This is the current utilization of the buffer, in samples.

* *Status* - "Playing" if sound is being played, "Stopped" otherwise

* *Elapsed* - Total time elapsed of the current render

* *Refresh rate* - Time since the last {ln-period}, should be Â±1ms of your
period setting in the {ln-audio-config} config.

* *Samples written* - Number of samples written to the buffer during the last
{ln-period}.

=== Clear

You can clear the *Underruns* counter by clicking on the btn:[Clear] button.
Useful for testing if a new sound configuration has any underruns.

== Refresh

By default, the dialog is automatically refreshed every 100 ms. You can change
the refresh rate by editing the spinbox or you can disable the auto-refresh by
checking off the *Auto-refresh* checkbox.

If auto-refresh is disabled the statistics will only be updated when you click
the *Refresh* button.

The btn:[Refresh] button can be clicked at any time to force update the
statistics.
