  "changes": "### Added\n - More test cases for File\n - tests for `Table<T>`\n - misc/genstep.py, similar to gensinc.py, generates bandlimited step sets for Osc\n - implementation for WaveOsc\n - NoiseGen, buffered version of NoiseChannel\n - Envelope, moved code from EnvChannel here (will replace EnvChannel)\n - Sweep class, replaces SweepPulseChannel\n - HardwareFile struct (replaces ChannelFile)\n\n### Changed\n - Fix exception being thrown when attempting to insert into table of size one less than maximum\n - Rewrote Osc class. Subclasses must edit the delta buffer manually instead of\n   using `deltaSet`.\n - Osc no longer uses sinc sets. It uses bandlimited steps instead, similiar to\n   blargg's http://www.slack.net/~ant/bl-synth/11.implementation.html. `Osc::generate`\n   uses floats for samples instead of int16_t. Samples range from -1.0-1.0, exceeding both\n   limits due to overshoot (so volume will need to be adjusted or clipping will occur).\n - Mixer no longer emulates terminal volume/panning (tracker doesn't use it)\n - Mixer works with sample buffers as opposed to individual samples from each channel\n - Length counters are no longer emulated by the Synth\n - Mixer and Sequencer were moved into Synth, as only the synth used these internally.\n\n### Removed\n  - `Osc::deltaSet` as only WaveOsc needed this method\n  - `Osc::setMute` and `Osc::muted`, replaced by `Osc::disable` and `Osc::disabled`\n  - misc/gensinc.py no longer needed, replaced by genstep.py\n  - Channel, EnvChannel, PulseChannel, SweepPulseChannel, WaveChannel, NoiseChannel,\n    ChannelFile, Mixer and Sequencer classes",
