  "changes": "### Added\n - `File::loadTable<T>` method\n - uint16_t overload for correctEndian\n - Destructor and copy constructor to `Table<T>`\n - `Table<T>::insert` methods\n - `Table<T>::clear`\n - Version struct + operator overloads\n\n### Changed\n - Rewrote implementation for `Table<T>`, no longer uses `std::unordered_map`\n   Uses a vector for the item data, and a 256 uint8_t array that maps an id\n   to an index in the vector. Allowing for faster lookups but a slight\n   performance loss when removing items.\n - Refactored pattern_demo.cpp and File.cpp to use new Table implementation\n - table size is now a 2 byte field when saving/loading\n - add setSpeed() overload to calculate speed from tempo/rpb settings. Song\n   no longer calculates speed when tempo or rpb is set.\n\n### Removed\n - `Table<T>::add`, `Table<T>::set`, as these methods are no longer needed as the\n   insert methods should be used instead.",
